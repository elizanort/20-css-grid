      <h1>Meet Kenzie</h1>
      <p>
        We founded Kenzie Academy to tackle a major opportunities gap in
        America. We discovered that fast-growing technology companies
        concentrated in expensive coastal cities were struggling to hire tech
        talent.
        Meanwhile, a large population of aspiring individuals across the country
        could help fuel these talent needs. Our mission is to equip this
        population with the necessary skills, experience, and access in order to
        build successful careers in tech.
